# BachPipeline

This pipeline generates musical sequences styled after Bach chorales.
This is primarily a demonstration of the constrained hidden Markov model (the model used for sequence generation).
The constrained hidden Markov model is described in detail in my [Master's thesis](https://porterglines.com/assets/Glines_Porter_MS.pdf).

By default, the constraints are that of the beginning and end of the first five measures of Bach's *"Wer nur den lieben Gott läßt walten"*.
In the image below, the constraints are highlighted in green.
